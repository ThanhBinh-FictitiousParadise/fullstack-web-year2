BKACAD Year 2 project - Commercial website

This is a demo version of my group’s second project.
It was built as part of our coursework, and while I contributed in multiple areas, my main focus was on the admin dashboard, charts, and calculation logic.

📌 How to use:
1. Import the provided .sql file into your database (for example, using phpMyAdmin).
2. Place the project folder inside your web server directory (example: htdocs/ for xampp)
3. To access admin page, type /admin into your search bar after your webhost in search bar, login as "test@gmail.com" and password is "123456"
These credentials are provided only for convenience, you can create your own account if you prefer.

📌 Although I contributed to debugging and frontend work as well, my main responsibility in this project was:
- Admin-side logic
- Charts and data visualization
- Calculations and data handling
-> This project helped me better understand backend logic and how data flows inside a real application.

This is a demo / learning project, not a production system. Some parts may be imperfect, but they reflect my real learning progress. The goal was functionality and understanding, not polish.
